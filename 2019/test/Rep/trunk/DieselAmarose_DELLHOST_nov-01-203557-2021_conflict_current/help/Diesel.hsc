\par 
\par \f0 This program is a helping vehicle to monitor in a visual way the status of 
\par diesel tank on board of a leisure boat.
\par 
\par \b Overview.
\par \b0 The program window is divided into three parts.
\par The upper for settings
\par The central for fuel consumption entry
\par The lower for data recording
\par 
\par On the left side there are two vertical bars, showing the fuel level and, in red color, the alarm level.\b 
\par \b0 
\par The use of the program is almost self explaining.
\par To start using :
\par 
\par \pard\tx200\cf3\b First  \b0 - enter settings.
\par \pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-200\li200\tx200 Average boat speed when motoring
\par {\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Fuel presumed or estimated hourly consumption in L/h\b\f1 
\par \f0{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}O\b0 verriding variation (enter an integer, will be read as %+ or % -) to be applied when evaluating the tank level after motoring.*\b\f1 
\par \b0\f0{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Maximum tank capability.\b\f1 
\par \b0\f0{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Estimated actual Tank (cannot be 0)\b\f1 
\par \f0{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Engine HOURS Start data (\b0 read below\b )\f1 
\par \pard\tx200\b0\f0 
\par \cf0\b One of the most important data \b0 for the evaluation of fuel consumption, is the \b Engine Hours counter\b0 .
\par \cf3\b It's mandatory that this instrument exist and works.\b0  
\par \cf0 Many data are based on the starting value of Engine Hours and on following readings.
\par \cf3 First time must be entered the \cf2 BASE reading\cf3  of engine hours Counter.
\par \cf0 
\par After some motoring it's possible to update the tank status by entering
\par the hours motored, with the same numeric format of the Base Hours .
\par Note: just enter the counter displayed figures, not the net hours motored.
\par 
\par When a refuel is done, then the additional fuel has to be loaded: using the "Add fuel" button. 
\par The same procedure can be used to subract fuel having care to enter digits with a minus sign. 
\par 
\par If the refueling is done with a total tank filling-up, before entering the liters of diesel, must be checked
\par the "Tank TopUp" checkbox. So it's possible to get the average real-time consumption, calculated from the 
\par Base Engine Hours, upto the latest burned fuel. 
\par 
\par The program will keep in memory last data entered and will calculate the nautical miles 
\par range, with the remaining diesel liters, on the basis of the average settings.
\par It's also possible to change the value of consumption rate, by enter an appropriate value for L/H, in the entry
\par box located on the right of the RANGE display. 
\par 
\par Total cumulative fuel burned will be displayed and can be reset.
\par 
\par \cf3\b *\cf0\b0  Sometime may happen a motoring leg is carried on not in a standard condition, as to 
\par   require the use of a cofficient to modify the normal calculation accordingly. 
\par 
\par There is also the possibility to have the average consumption as function of Engine RPM. This data
\par is \cf3\b valid \cf0\b0 for the engines listed in the "Engine - Select" pop down menu.\b 
\par 
\par \b0 There is a set of \b RadioButtons\b0  where it's possible to fix which type of consumption rate must be used to
\par calculate the burned fuel. Of course the RadioButton setting must be fixed before entering the last Engine
\par Hours data.
\par Summarizing: Consumption calculation may use:
\par \tab\tab\tab 1) Standard (default) liters/hours, from initial settings 
\par \tab\tab\tab 2) Plus or minus rate variation (worse/better), due to special conditions
\par \tab\tab\tab 3) RPM dependent consumption (based on the specific engine data)
\par \tab\tab\tab 4) Consumption rate calculated after two Tank Up refuelling
\par 
\par It is possible to modify the "estimated parameters", during the use of the software, just clicking the button "Modify Estimated".
\par So doing you may change default speed, consumption rate, overriding percentage and the Tank Alarm setting.
\par 
\par A\cf2\b\i  log\cf0\b0\i0  is provided to show all the principal entries performed. It can be reset.
\par 
\par 
\par The following picture can be of help. The use of buttons and Edit Entry is self explanatory.
